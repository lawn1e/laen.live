      <h2>Trees and Me: A Heartfelt Tale</h2>

        Posted by user: TreeEnthusiast3000x <br><br>
        Ever since I was young, I would plant a tree everyday. All day, every day was just dedicated to planting trees. It never stopped. 
        I couldn't stop. Soon there were trees everywhere. It became a problem. I was running out of space. The authorities wanted to take my trees away from me. 
        But I wouldn't let them. All my hard work. Gone just like that? I couldn't let that happen. I packed up all my trees and fled the country. They couldn't catch me. 
        I was too fast. I ran on the wavelength of my trees. We were one singular being. I was a tree and my trees were me. Even though I was on the run, I never stopped planting trees. 
        Everyday, one tree. Every night, one tree. I planted and ran. It never stopped. I never wanted to stop.
        <br><br>
        One day, I decided to stop running. Why run when I am not afraid anymore? Why run when I have the protection of the trees around me? No one could touch me or my trees. 
        I wanted to settle down. To plant my trees in stagnant soil. So I did. I did and I settled. Now I live together surrounded by my trees. And so can you.
